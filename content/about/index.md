A Senior Software Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems and building scalable, high-performance systems. Over the past decade, I've had the privilege of contributing to a diverse range of projects across various industries and technologies.

My journey in software engineering started with a strong foundation in C# and .NET development. I've since expanded my skillset to include expertise in cloud technologies (AWS, GCP), big data processing (Apache Spark, Hadoop, BigQuery), and modern web development (React, TypeScript).

Throughout my career, I've consistently sought out opportunities to tackle challenging technical problems and deliver solutions that directly impact business outcomes. I'm particularly proud of my work on data engineering pipelines, performance optimization, and building tools that empower other teams.
